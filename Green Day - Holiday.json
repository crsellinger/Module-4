(Amen!)\nThere's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)\nA gag, a plastic bag on a monument\n\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nOn holiday!\n\n(Hey!)\n\n(Three, four!)\n\n\"The representative from California has the floor.\"\n\nSieg Heil to the president gas man\nBombs away is your punishment\nPulverize the Eiffel towers\nWho criticize your government\nBang bang goes the broken glass\nKill all the fags who don't agree\nTrials by fire, set in fire\nIs not a way that's meant for me\nJust cause, just cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!\n\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n\nThis is our lives on holiday"}}
