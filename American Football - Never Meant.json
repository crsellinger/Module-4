(I am ready)\nWe- We can keep that one, right?\nReady?\nOne, two\nOne, two, three\n\nLet's just forget everything said\nAnd everything we did\nBest friends and better halves\nGoodbyes\nAnd the autumn night when we realized\nWe were falling out of love\n\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said that weren't meant\nThere were some things that were said\nBut we never did\n\nNot to be overly (Overly)\nDramatic\nI just think it's best\n'Cause you can't miss what you forget\nSo, let's just pretend\nEverything and anything\nBetween you and me\nWas never meant\n\nWas never meant"}}
