What if I should die?!\nA place inside my brain, another kind of pain\nYou don't know the chances. I'm so blind!\n\nAnother place I find to escape the pain inside\nYou don't know the chances. What if I should die?!\nA place inside my brain, another kind of pain\nYou don't know the chances. I'm so blind!\n\nDeeper and deeper and deeper as I journey to\nlive a life that seems to be a lost reality\nthat I can never find a way to reach.\nMy inner selfesteem is low.\nHow deep can I go in the ground that I lay?\nIf I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.\nThis time I look to see what's between the lines!\n\nI can see, I can see, I'm going blind... [x12]\nI'm blind [x4]"}}
